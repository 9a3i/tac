The vector representation can then be used to train a *model*, which is an algorithms to create different representations of the data, which are usually more semantic. These three concepts are key to understanding how `gensim` works so let's take a moment to explain what each of them means. At the same time, we'll work through a simple example that illustrates each of them.\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"### Corpus\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n\n\n    \"A *corpus* is a collection of digital documents. This collection is the input to `gensim` from which it will infer the structure of the documents, their topics, etc. The latent structure inferred from the corpus can later be used to assign topics to new documents which were not present in the training corpus. For this reason, we also refer to this collection as the *training corpus*. No human intervention (such as tagging the documents by hand) is required - the topic classification is [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning).\\n\",\n\n\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"For our corpus, we'll use a list of 9 strings, each consisting of only a single sentence.\"\n   ]\n  },\n  {\n   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n   \"execution_count\": 1,\n   \"metadata\": {\n    \"collapsed\": true\n   },\n   \"outputs\": [],\n   \"source\": [\n    \"raw_corpus = [\\\"Human machine interface for lab abc computer applications\\\",\\n\",\n    \"             \\\"A survey of user opinion of computer system response time\\\",\\n\",\n    \"             \\\"The EPS user interface management system\\\",\\n\",\n    \"             \\\"System and human system engineering testing of EPS\\\",              \\n\",\n    \"             \\\"Relation of user perceived response time to error measurement\\\",\\n\",\n    \"             \\\"The generation of random binary unordered trees\\\",\\n\",\n    \"             \\\"The intersection graph of paths in trees\\\",\\n\",\n    \"             \\\"Graph minors IV Widths of trees and well quasi ordering\\\",\\n\",\n    \"             \\\"Graph minors A survey\\\"]\"\n   ]\n  },\n  {\n   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n   \"metadata\": {},\n   \"source\": [\n     \"This is a particularly small example of a corpus for illustration purposes.

Under the bag-of-words model each document is represented by a vector containing the frequency counts of each word in the dictionary. For example, given a dictionary containing the words `['coffee', 'milk', 'sugar', 'spoon']` a document consisting of the string `\\\"coffee milk coffee\\\"` could be represented by the vector `[2, 1, 0, 0]` where the entries of the vector are (in order) the occurrences of \\\"coffee\\\", \\\"milk\\\", \\\"sugar\\\" and \\\"spoon\\\" in the document.
